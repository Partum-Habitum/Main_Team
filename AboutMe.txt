Hello,

My name is Jai Delany. I am 21 years old and was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico. 
I spent 2 years traveling the country playing junior hockey and when I decided to stop I began attending WCC. 
I was originally going to go into chemistry and got a job as a pharmaceutical research lab as a technician and after experiencing industry, decided it was not for me. 
I am currently pursing my associates degree in Information System Programming with hopes to attend a four year school to get a bachelors in cybersecurity.
