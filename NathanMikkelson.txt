My name is Nathan Mikkelson, I am currently working towards an AS in CS. I am currently employed with St. Joseph Mercy
Hospital where I have been the past 10 years. I'm married and have 3 children ages 9, 6 and 4. In my spare time I enjoy 
playing Magic the Gathering, playing baseball for Ann Arbor Rec. and managing baseball statistics with google sheets and 
excel.
