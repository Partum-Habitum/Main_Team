My name is Brandon Devereux. I retired from the USAF in 2017, around that time my wife and I moved to Michigan. This is my final semester at WCC, graduating with an AS in CS, focus in Java. I have experience with Java, Android and PHP. 

I have a one year old son, with a daughter on the way! Due in June/July. In my free time I like to spend time with my family, code and play video games.
